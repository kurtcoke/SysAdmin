SysAdmin:
-------------

If I'm finished reading the Book of PF I will put all of this in a nice and easy to read format
on my blog.

For now this is just a place to store my endless amount of notes about sysadmin related stuff related to Linux and FreeBSD for now. Will
be using OpenBSD more in the future.  My configs will also be in here.
